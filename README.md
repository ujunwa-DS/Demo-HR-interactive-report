# Demo-HR-interactive-report
Power Bi is a very good tool for building  interactive report hence the reason why I choose it for building this report. A dirty data which its cleaning required merging of query, appending of query, adding of conditional column etc as a method of preprocessing it. Interactive visual was build with its design partly done in microsoft power point.
